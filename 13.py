mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] 
smallest_number = min(mylist)
largest = max(mylist)
print(f'the smallest number:{smallest_number}')
print(f'the largest number is:{largest}')


# the second way of solving this task

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# # numbers.sort()
# smallest = numbers[0]
# largest = numbers[-1]
# print = (smallest)
# print = (largest)
